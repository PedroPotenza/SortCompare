# Empiric Analysis of Sort Methods
This project was coded using C progamming language as part of the Algorithms Analysis course of UNESP (Universidade Estadual Paulista) teached by Professor Daniel Carlos Guimar√£es Pedronette.

# Contributors
This project has 4 main contributors Dante Escame, Gustavo Henrique Manarin, Gabriel Tetzlaf and Pedro Potenza, all of them are studying in Computer Science at UNESP.

# Objectives
The main object of the project was to compare the main sorting algorithms using statitics measures. To achieve it, we developed a program that can run a selected number of times each sort algorithm and calculate its number of comparisons, time of execution and standard deviation (of time). 

# Algorithms
In this project we tested Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick and Heap Sort
